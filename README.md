# esophageal-cancer-integrative-networks
This study aimed to reveal the high-confident genomic features and the associated regulatory mechanisms involved in ESCC and EAC using multiple types of genomic data. Firstly, we constructed systems biology networks with mRNA-miRNA-DNA methylation interactions embedded using datasets from TCGA. Then genomic features associated with clinical phenotypes and known esophageal cancer-related genes and miRNAs were systematically collected and mapped to the networks. We next conceived an algorithm to distill the networks, resulting in the identification of 148 high-confident genomic features, which could be potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers. Finally, two external datasets were used to validate the prognostic power of the revealed high-confident genes. The systems biology networks constructed here can facilitate identification of reliable biomarkers/therapeutic targets and the associated regulatory mechanisms, which are of great value in translational medicine in esophageal cancer.
